    <h1>Types of Art: Different Forms of Art To Know (With Examples)</h1>
  </header>
  
  <main>
    <p>Art is a way for people to express themselves that comes from their creativity and talent as well as from human civilization and culture. Visual, literary, and performing arts are the three primary categories of art. The art form can be both singular and universal, strong yet understated, audacious and modest, all at once.
        A person's emotions, feelings, thoughts, wants, and desires can all be expressed via art. It frequently says what words are unable to. It is that which gives meaning to things beyond language. It might also contain a lesson or a tale.
        The primary quality shared by all forms of art is their ability to arouse the senses. Whatever the medium, they are all storytellers. Another important but maybe oblique message that art delivers to its viewers is profound.
        There are three main categories of the arts. These are the following:
        1.	Literary Arts
        2.	Performing Arts
        3.	Visual Arts
        <br>
        <br>
        The essence of the visual arts is mostly visual. Seven categories of visual arts exist:
        1.	Ceramics
        2.	Drawing
        3.	Painting
        4.	Photography
        5.	Sculpture
        6.	Conceptual Art
        7.	Architecture
        <br>
        <br>
        All written works are included under the Literary Arts. There are three primary literary arts:
        1.	Poetry
        2.	Fiction
        3.	Non-Fiction
        <br>
        <br>
        The performing arts are types of art where physical movement is necessary. The following are the top three performing arts genres:
        1.	Dance
        2.	Theatre
        3.	Music
